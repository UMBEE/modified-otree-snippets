<p>Choose what investment to make at an APR of {{ C.APR }}</p>
The fields below are populated by raw oTree forms. Ideally, we'd like to track
the sequence of attempts one makes before submitting.

One useful generalization of this logging method is to inject the intermediate
choices before one settles in a risk-elicitation choice-list experiment.

        // isNaN is the javascript function that checks whether the value is a valid
        // number. need to check this because the field might be empty or
        // the user might have typed something other than a number.
