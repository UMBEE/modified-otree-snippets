    Here is the raw record of all your attempts. Note, the raw sequence is stored in a model-field for the player, as: calculator_log. This is a string field, with ";" as the splitter. 
    
    Each bit denotes the <pre>p-q-timetag</pre> info, where p = price, q=quantity, and timetag denotes the time when the calculate button is pressed.
